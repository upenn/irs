# IRS: Institutional Requirements System

This is a pure-client-side web app that encodes the degree requirements for the University of Pennsylvania CIS (and ESE undergrad) degrees. 
It is intended to quickly and reliably answer the question: 
> what courses does this student need to graduate?

IRS is an attempt to represent rulebooks like the [SEAS Undergraduate Handbook](https://ugrad.seas.upenn.edu/student-handbook/), the [CIS Advising Handbook](https://advising.cis.upenn.edu) and the [Registrar's degree requirements](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/engineering-applied-science/majors/) in code instead of prose. It is built and maintained by the [CIS Academic Advising](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/undergraduate/advising/) team. Note that IRS is an **unofficial** tool. The [University Registrar](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/engineering-applied-science/majors/) is the ultimate arbiter of degree requirements.
